American Economic Review Pointers:

- Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material before the first section heading.
- Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).
- Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.
- Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.
- The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.
- If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just remove the package or see our technical support document online (please refer to the author instructions).
- At the moment, appendices after the references section is not supported by pandoc.  See https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/771
- Citations: Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex but not both.
